We want to minimize the cost, so the lower the number the better the state. We make no assumptions about the cost being non-negative, i.e., there may be states with a negative cost (i.e., a gain) - such an approach enables us to consider both maximization and minimization problems within a single framework. We also replace the property `intial_state` with the funtion `random_state` which is supposed to return a randomly generated state for the problem.
