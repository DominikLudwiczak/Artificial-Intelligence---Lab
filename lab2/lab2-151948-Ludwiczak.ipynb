    "Depth-first search and breadth-first search considered in the previous lesson are completely *blind* algorithms: they're only concerned whether the currently considered state is a goal state or not. They're unable to distinguish whether a state is easy or hard to reach, or whether it is near or far of the goal. This makes them very inefficient search algorithms. To allievate the issue, we introduce informed search algorithms. The information is given to an algorithm in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By using an *action cost* function $c(s,a)$, which, given a state $s$ and an action $a$ available in this state, returns its cost as a non-negative number.\n",
    "2. By using a *heuristic* $h(s)$, which, given a state, estimates the lowest cost to reach a goal state from the given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of actions $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ and an initial state $s_1$, we can express the *total cost* of reaching the state $s_{n+1}$ by executing the sequence as:\n",
    "$$ c(s_1, a_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c(s_i, a_i) $$\n",
    "and the *expected cost* of the solution as the sum of the total cost and the estimate cost of reaching the goal from the state $s_{n+1}$\n",
    "$$ f(s_1, a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = c(s_1, a_1, \\ldots, a_n) + h(s_{n+1}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic function is a bit tricky, because we want it to have two properties:\n",
    "* *Admissibility*: It must never *overestimate* the true cost of reaching the goal. \n",
    "* *Consistency*: Let $s$ be a state such that $a$ is an available action in this state and $s'$ is the state reached by executing this action. The heuristic should fulfil triangle inequality, that is, the estimated cost to reach the goal from $s$ should be no greater than the cost of executing the action $a$ + the estimated cost of reaching the goal from the new state.\n",
    "$$ h(s) \\leq c(s, a) + h(s') $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One can prove that admissibility follows from consistency, but consistency is important only if there are multiple paths to reach the same state (i.e., we are searching in a graph, not in a tree). Otherwise, admissability is sufficient."
